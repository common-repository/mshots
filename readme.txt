Easily insert screenshots of any website into your blog with a shortcode.

== Description ==

WordPress.com has a service called mShots that allows you to easily insert screenshots of any website into your blog. This simple plugin lets you use mShots with a shortcode.

Example Usage:
`[mshot url="http://wpforchurch.com" alt="WordPress plugins and themes for churches and ministries" w="600" h=""300"]`
This will generate a screenshot (that gets updated automatically). The image will link to the url in a new window.

Images will not always display instantly. Some take longer than others, but they'll show up eventually. 

The idea and code for this plugin comes from here: http://www.wprecipes.com/wordpress-shortcode-display-a-thumbnail-of-any-website/

1. Just use the "Add New" button in Plugin section of your WordPress blog's Control panel. To find the plugin there, search for 'mShots'
1. Activate the plugin 
1. Place the shortcode with parameters if needed in your posts or pages
